    <description><![CDATA[<p>I learned a lot of physics in 2018, and here is a summary!</p>
<h2 id="first-half-the-year">First Half the Year</h2>
<p>In January, I finished <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx&#43;8.04.1x&#43;3T2017/course/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer "><strong>8.04x, Quantum Mechanics</strong></a> an online course provided by MITx and got perfect grades, 92, 94, and 88 for three exams.
8.04x was lectured by Professor Barton Zwiebach, whose doctoral advisor is Murray Gell-mann.
This course introduced basic concepts of Quantum Mechanics and did standard 1-D potential examples, such as square wells, Dirac-delta potential and harmonic oscillators, along with several important theorems for 1-D potential.
Besides, it gave a detailed treatment on scattering states in 1-D, covering topics like time delay, Levinson&rsquo;s theorem and resonance.
The course ended with central potential and Hydrogen Atom.
It was a challenging but rewarding course, and of course, interesting!
What makes this course stand out among all other online courses is its active discussion forum.
I met lots of interesting physics and math geeks there, Mark, Jolyon, Jim, BlueFlow and Jonathan, and the discussion about physics with them made my learn experience vivid and lovely (Actually, I read their discussions in forum most of the time).
Later in September 2018, Jim offered me an unexpected research experience, which was the first time I worked with a real physicist!</p>]]></description>
