    <description><![CDATA[<p>Where to learn entry-level particle physics? Like most people, I have been hearing about words like &ldquo;quarks, hadrons, leptons&rdquo; since junior high school. However, I have never known the next step for learning more about them. The talk by David Gross during <a href="https://xllyu.org/quantum-connection-2023-summer-school/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">a summer school in Sweden last summer</a> completely aroused interest in this subject.</p>
<p>During the lunar new year season, which was early February this year, I found time to dive into this subject a little. I want to first get an overview of this subject, focusing on building a physical picture and intuitive feelings, avoiding technical details as much as possible. Therefore, I started exploring all kinds of textbooks and videos to searchfor what I want.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>]]></description>
