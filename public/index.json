Like most people, I have been hearing about words like “quarks, hadrons, leptons” since junior high school. However, I have never known the next step for learning more about them. The talk by David Gross during a summer school in Sweden last summer completely aroused interest in this subject. During the lunar new year season, which was early February this year, I found time to dive into this subject a little. I want to first get an overview of this subject, focusing on building a physical picture and intuitive feelings, avoiding technical details as much as possible. Therefore, I started exploring all kinds of textbooks and videos to searchfor what I want.

The first two chapters of this textbook, however, are what I’m looking for. It is a nice overview of several central questions, for example, from what evidence do we start to suspect a particle, like a proton, has inner structure, while some others, like an electron, doesn’t. Starting from chapter 3, detailed mathematical calculations come up. One of the feature of this textbook is that it only employed one-particle quantum mechanics to describe motions of elementary particles, avoiding a full but much more intricate and complicated field theory treatment.

His lectures and Feynman’s lectures share a very similar style. In his supplemental course, I found a series of 3 courses on Particle Physics, and also one course on Advanced Quantum Mechanics. As a warm-up, I first chose to take a look at the Advanced QM class I found hidden much jewelry. The first three lectures demonstrate how the rotational symmetry of an atom entails the degenerate structure in hydrogen atom energy spectrum. He then moved on, in the next two lectures, talking about how Pauli discovered the internal spin of electrons by studying this spectrum. There is a very fascinating discussion about the relationship between spin and fermion nature of electrons. The last five lectures focus on developing quantum field theory (QFT) formalism in the non-relativistic case. This exposition is hard to find elsewhere. Most QFT textbook starts by a full relativistic treatment, which makes it very hard to understand its connection with the non-relativistic QM taught in undergraduate time. The last lecture contains many intuitive discussions about the relativistic QFT of electron, Dirac equation, like how to understand the mysterious multi-component form of the electron wave function: where does the spin come and where does the concept of anti-particle comes.

It was exciting and happy to study with so many young girls together: there are about 50 students who were major in Japanese but only five fellows! For a boy focusing on science side in high school in China, he had hardly seen over 10 girls during his whole high school life. Such a situation could not be better! Sadly, the boy read too many science popular books and was more curious about peculiar quantum mechanics, or even string theory at that time, so he decided to change his major. He first did some research on physics major in his university, but it turned out the people in the physics department look nothing like the characters in his book: Niels Bohr, Wolfgang Pauli, Richard Feynman, Albert Einstein, etc. As a result, he had to take the second best and went to civil engineering major, hoping he could meet more geek-like people there, since it was (and still is) the department with the most eminent professors and students in the country. He started his undergraduate training in structure engineering in 2014. He got a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering in 2017 but his dream of becoming a physicist remained.

Cute Feynman Feynman talking to Dirac The thought of becoming a physicist started to haunt me when I was a high school student. I was intended to change my major to physics as mentioned above. However, the decisive moment was when I thought about what to do after graduation in the summer of 2016, when I just finished most of my undergraduate coursework in civil engineering. I asked myself: what do you want to do as a career on which I need to spend over 8 hours a day, 5 days a week at least, of my time? It is about 8 / 24 × 5 / 7 = 0.23 ~ 1/4 of my time! I must be comfortable and happy about it, or my life will suck! The answer was not clear immediately but I tried to break the analysis piece by piece: Do I want to find a structural-engineering-related job in the future? The answer was negative at that point. Structural engineering, as its name indicates, is too engineering for me. People in this subject don’t like to push the technology too much (I mean really push the technology to its boundary) because it is a very traditional subject. They care about real life problems, which I think is awesome, but the approach is just unattractive to me. After all, as long as you can build the bridge and it does not cost much, it is all right. Further scientific questions do not seem necessary in this area, most people just do not care about them too much. Of course, there are my very personal feelings. I just cannot get the interesting side of engineering. So structure engineering did not look like my game. I was and would always be a science geek, and would definitely look like a heretic in engineering area. Furthermore, I hate drawing blueprint. It is not my game. Should I pursue a career to become a physicist? I was not 100% sure. Unlike civil engineering, I had not studied anything about modern physics seriously, so I was not sure whether I really enjoy physics. However, I did know many physicists, and they are all geeks, just like me. So it looked like I might want to be a physicist, or at least, to have physics-related career in the future. What should I do now? The catch here was that I was not familiar about physics so not 100% sure I should go that way. A reasonable choice was to teach myself undergraduate level physics courses on my own. When I become familiar about physics, I can make the decision. I started my undergraduate-level physics course self-study project in September 2016. Besides the reason stated above, another important reason for starting this project is the nature of physics learning (when choosing a career, it is better to know something about its nature in advance): there is no royal way to physics! In physics, you must build up concepts piece by piece, so there is no way I can do graduate-level physics without a thorough understanding of undergraduate-level physics. I quote Mark Weitzman, who is the best TA in all physics and mathematics online courses, “One of the attractive features of theoretical physics is that it is tightly integrated (much more so than fields like mathematics) – and every area of physics engages in a large interaction and borrowing of techniques and concepts, from other areas of physics.” It is very different from subjects like civil engineering, or finance, etc., where the technical entry barrier is relatively lower (I am not say other subjects are not important. They are of course very important. I am talking about some features of these careers). One thing I did not take into consideration at all at that point is what are the chances to be admitted to a PhD program in top institute for a student who does not have a traditional physics education background like me. I did not even ask around. One thing is that the cases of transitioning to physics from other fields are so rare, you could only find a few cases on the internet, and there were not many details about how they managed to do that (This is the main motivation for me to write thi","date":"2019-06-24","objectID":"/posts/pursue-physics/:1:0","tags":null,"title":"Pursue Your Passion and Results Will Be Unexpected — Boosting Your Career Through Independent Learning","uri":"/posts/pursue-physics/"},{"categories":["Year-end Reivew"],"content":"PART II: How Does the Self-Study Project Work? edX, a massive open online course provider MIT open courseware, or MIT/OCW Coursera, a massive open online course provider Caltech's Physics Course Schedule and Websites The idea of starting a self-study project was inspired by Scott H. Young’s MIT challenge. He basically finished the entire 4-year MIT curriculum for computer science in one year. Then I thought to myself: I basically finished the entire 4-year Tongji curriculum for civil engineering in three years, so a challenge like Young’s looked very interesting. As a result, I started the physics challenge. Next decision was whether I should study physics using Chinese or English material. After some research, I found there were much more excellent learning materials in English than in Chinese. What’s more, the big treasure for all independent learners (not necessarily for physics or computer science learners), MIT/OCW, has all its learning material in English, so my decision was to learn physics using English materials directly. The main sources I used are the pictures I listed above. edX and Coursera are two massive open online courser providers (MOOC providers). MIT/OCW is the source Young used to accomplish his MIT challenge. Most courses in MIT/OCW provide syllabus, reading materials, assignments and their solutions, and exams. Some courses even provide lecture videos. A few courses (mostly first-year college courses like Calculus, basic physics, biology, chemistry, or basic programming has the so-called OCW scholar version, whose learning materials are integrated carefully to make the study convenient for independent learners (the course number of such courses have an SC suffix). The truth is as long as you have basic English skills (high school level is enough for foreign learners), MIT/OCW is a fascinating place to learn college-level courses and to boost your life experience. A good lecturer knows about his/her audience and never assumes the audience knows everything, and will work you through all the details. You will find most lectures of courses in MIT/OCW are such good lectures. For physics learners, Caltech’s Physics Course Schedule and Websites is also a good place to find learning materials. How to study independently if given these sources? Different source formats have different learning experiences, but as learning process, the basic spirit is the same. Think about how we study in a college (or a high school). There are roughly three steps: attending lectures, completing assignments, and taking exams. The first two steps are crucial for independent learners. Since there is no lectures to attend, we will watch video lectures if the course provides, or read the textbooks. Then do the exercises. Doing exercises is the most important step. Nobody learns only by attending lectures or reading books, especially for science and engineering subjects. Practice makes perfect. Since doing exercises is important, it is recommended for the beginners to find courses providing assignments solutions, or to find the books with solution manuals. For exams, if the course (or the book) provides one, take it, if not, just forget it. Specifically, For MOOCs and OCW scholar version courses, just take them as ordinary courses you take in school. They organize the material carefully for you. They are the best version for independent learners. For courses on MIT/OCW and Caltec’s course schedule and websites, do what I suggested above. One additional suggestion about independent learning. Most independent learners will have their own jobs to do on workdays. I was in structure engineering graduate school of Tongji while carrying on my self-study project. There was much work to do in graduate school. For a serious independent learner, it is necessary to plan carefully and write the learning tasks into your schedule. Another useful trick is to keep timing your learning process. It will give you an idea about how much work you spend into ","date":"2019-06-24","objectID":"/posts/pursue-physics/:2:0","tags":null,"title":"Pursue Your Passion and Results Will Be Unexpected — Boosting Your Career Through Independent Learning","uri":"/posts/pursue-physics/"},{"categories":["Year-end Reivew"],"content":"PART III: What Courses Did You Study Specifically? For those who want to study physics on their own, I list all the courses I have finished, or partly finished in my undergraduate-level physics course self-study project. (note: If the link below gives you an archived mode course in edX, you can search the course in edX to see whether there is a current-running version.) From September 2016 to June 2017 Even though I know much about freshman level physics, I started my self-study project with two MIT’s freshman physics courses 8.01 and 8.02, mainly to get myself familiar with the whole self learning process and to get myself used to English environment. (one bonus fact: studying courses with video lectures and assignments in English is extremely useful for getting a high TOEFL score. I took my first try on TOEFL before the self-study project in May 2016 after preparing for three months and got 96. My second TOEFL exam was in April 2017, half a year after starting my project, without preparing for the exam specially, and I got 105.) Here are the courses I studied: 8.01.1x – 3x, Physics I, Classical Mechanics. I was lucky that edX version for 8.01, first introductory physics course about mechanics, was launched for the first time. It covers Newton’s vector formulation of mechanics. First you draw the forces and then do some analysis. As always, conservation laws are emphasized: linear momentum conservation, angular momentum conservation and energy conservation. Easy piece for me, and my final grade is (99+100+92)/3=97. 8.02, Physics II, Electricity and Magnetism. I took the version lectured by Professor Walter Lewin. For some reason, Prof. Lewin’s lectures are not available on MIT/OCW anymore, but he kindly put all the video lectures on YouTube. The assignments and solutions can also be found in the introduction section of each video. Electricity and Magnetism is like magic in science, and Prof. Lewin’s demonstration shows the magic before your own eyes. I recommend this course for all people who are interested in engineering and science. It’s just exciting to see how electricity and magnetism work! BTW, there is a edX version 8.02x, but I haven’t taken it, you can take a look at it if you are interested. My final grade is 95.8 8.03, Physics III, Vibrations and Waves. I took the version lectured by Professor Walter Lewin. There is a OCW Scholar Version of 8.03 on MIT/OCW now. I still strongly recommend Prof. Lewin’s lectures. Basically, this course deals with second order differential equations, wave equations and electromagnetic waves, from a physics perspective. Like 8.02, this course has lots of demonstrations, one of which is that your tune of speaking will become very high, and you will sound like a character in anime after inhaling the Helium. 8.03 will have many applications in engineering. One of my course on structural dynamics covers the similar material, less fundamental but more engineering. I nailed the structural dynamics course with knowledge I learned in 8.03 and got 98 in the exam. My final grade for 8.03 is 89. 18.031x, Introduction to Differential Equations. An excellent mathematics course that covers the simplest ordinary differential equations. It is normally taken by sophomore students in MIT. This course deals with second order differential equations too, but from a mathematical point of view. I recommend taking it with 8.03. I think it is a course that should be taken by every science and engineering major student. The world around us is described by the language of differential equations and this course is the first baby step to study them. I wonder why such a course is not in the curriculum for civil engineering in my university. My final grade is 99. An introductory course on complex analysis.

Professor Naoki Kawashima, whom I chose as my supervisor in UTokyo is an acquaintance of Jim, so Jim’s letter means a lot to him. I believe this is the reason why UTokyo gives me one offer. I was actually not aware of such fact when I sent email to Prof. Kawashima. The reason why I found Prof. Kawashima is that I felt very interested in his research area. It was the course _Statistical Mechanics: Algorithms and Computations _provided by École Normale Supérieure that gave me such motivations. Everything comes naturally from my self-study project, though the most crucial ones come quite unexpectedly. However, that is why life is interesting, you never know what would happen. Hard work is necessary, and luck is also indispensable. 2019 is a lucky year for me and I am going to be a theoretical physicist! Give physics a huge hug!

Before attending UTokyo in September this year, I still need to learn more physics on my own. Here are my plans for first half year: My first group theory study: Group Theory in a Nutshell for Physicists by Antony Zee. I started learning this book early this year, and spent lots of time during winter vacation (Spring festival). I finished studying Part I ~ Part VI in April, but I didn’t go much detail into Dynkin Diagrams. Plan to find time to finish the remaining chapters, maybe later this year. The last undergraduate quantum mechanics course: 8.06x Applications of Quantum Mechanics by Barton Zwiebach. This MITx course is the last one of MIT’s quantum mechanics course series, the best online course among all MOOCs! It started in February and will end on July 6. So I continued my quantum mechanics study with Prof. Zwiebach, Jolyon, Jim, Mark, Gleeson, Walter, Nicholas and all others. Rich experience! A Statistics course: 18.6501x Fundamentals of Statistics. This course is not as excellent as other MITx courses I took, and I felt a little boring. I didn’t even attend its final exam, but I passed the course with final grade 71%. My second complex analysis course: Complex Analysis with Physical Applications by two Russian physicists: Prof. Yaroslav Rodionov and Prof. Konstantin Tikhonov. This is a tough course with 9 units, one unit a week. I didn’t survive dedicated problem in Week 7 but I have not given up yet. I think I can finish the last two weeks. My first general relativity study: Einstein Gravity in a Nutshell by Antony Zee. I started study this book together with Zee’s group theory book. However, the study was interrupted for a while starting from mid May, because I needed to work on my term paper for 8.06x and treat Professor Ballarini’s family after they arrived in Shanghai on May 20. And now I’m working on my master’s thesis and still haven’t pick it up. I should finish my first draft of my thesis as soon as possible! A string course for undergraduates: A First Course in String Theory by Barton Zwiebach. This is an excellent course and there are video lectures by Prof. Zwiebach on PSI’s website or YouTube. I started to study this book in April but the study was interrupted in mid May for the same reason stated above. I haven’t restarted it yet. My first quantum field theory course: Quantum Field Theory by Mark Srednicki. I started to learn it in April but the study was interrupted and I still haven’t pick it up. Here are my plans for second half year. Since I don’t know what the study life will be like in UTokyo, this plan is tentative. A course on quantum optics: Quantum Optics 1 : Single Photons provided by École Polytechnique and lectured by Alain Aspect and Michel Bruce. This course is recommended by Jim and is closed related to my 8.06x term paper. It will start on June 24. The second part of this course will run for the first time in September and I will add it here when it starts. My second course on statistical mechanics: 8.333 Statistical Mechanics I: Statistical Mechanics of Particles and 8.334 Statistical Mechanics II: Statistical Physics of Fields by Mehran Kardar. Some courses on condensed matter physics: maybe Quantum Many-particle Systems by Negele and Orland, or Condensed Matter Field Theory by Altland and Simons. I would like to read Feynman’s book Quantum Mechanics and Path Integrals. I should take a course on undergraduate level mathematical physics. Mark’s suggestion is Kevin Cahill’s video lectures on mathematical physics Spring 2017 Physics 467 Physical Mathematics. More on classical physics: Modern Classical Physics: Optics, Fluids, Plasmas, Elasticity, Relativity, and Statistical Physics by Kip S. Thorne and Roger D. Blandford.

This course introduced basic concepts of Quantum Mechanics and did standard 1-D potential examples, such as square wells, Dirac-delta potential and harmonic oscillators, along with several important theorems for 1-D potential. Besides, it gave a detailed treatment on scattering states in 1-D, covering topics like time delay, Levinson’s theorem and resonance. The course ended with central potential and Hydrogen Atom. It was a challenging but rewarding course, and of course, interesting! What makes this course stand out among all other online courses is its active discussion forum. I met lots of interesting physics and math geeks there, Mark, Jolyon, Jim, BlueFlow and Jonathan, and the discussion about physics with them made my learn experience vivid and lovely (Actually, I read their discussions in forum most of the time). Later in September 2018, Jim offered me an unexpected research experience, which was the first time I worked with a real physicist! 8.04x, Quantum Mechanics 8.370x, Quantum Information Science February is holiday season in China, I finished Jacob Linder’s video lectures on Classical Mechanics, based on Goldstein’s textbook. Jacob Linder walked you through Goldstein’s book step by step, demonstrating many examples, so you could learn to do these calculations with him. However, since I’ve learned much about Mechanics in Mechanic Engineering courses in my home institute and want to learn more about Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Formulations, it turned out that this course was too introductory for me. It didn’t go much deep in these two formulations and the problem sets were not quite challenging. I would recommend this course to those who learned classical mechanics for the first time. In addition, I tried 8.370x, Quantum Information Science, provided by MITx. This course was not as excellent as 8.04x, so I only finished the first part. I planed to study quantum information theory after finishing 8.04—06 series. The spring semester in my home institute started in March, as did the continuation Quantum Mechanics course 8.05x, Mastering Quantum Mechanics. 8.05x started by reviewing key theorems for 1-D potential. The treatment was more systematic and rigorous than 8.04x. After introducing the mind-boggling Stern-Gerlach experiment that demonstrated the quantum mechanical nature of nature, it continued to give rigorous explanation of operators and vector space followed by Dirac’s bra and ket notation. After the training of the first half part of 8.05x, your mind would be quite familiar about operators and vectors. The remaining part focused on the application of operator and algebraic method on examples like harmonic oscillators and angular momentum. Coherent state and squeeze state were also introduced, which is kind of introduction to quantum optics. 8.05x, Mastering Quantum Mechanics 6.041x, Introduction to Probability My feeling was that 8.05x was not as difficult as 8.04x. It represented the same idea of quantum mechanics using operator and algebraic approach, which I think is much superior to differentiation and integration approach. The important information can be encapsulated compactly into the algebraic relation of operators (or more specific, commutators) and the derivation will be mostly algebra manipulation, which is much easier and more straightforward than dealing with differentiation and integration. Remember how the algebraic method for harmonic oscillator works like magic, and the calculation of related expectation values will be quite trivial using abstract states, annihilation and creation operators, without requiring any specific representation in position or momentum space. 6.041x, Introduction to Probability: Part 2—Inference and Processes, ran in p","date":"2019-01-21","objectID":"/posts/summary-for-2018/:1:0","tags":null,"title":"Summary for 2018","uri":"/posts/summary-for-2018/"},{"categories":["Year-end Reivew"],"content":"Second Half of the Year Second half of 2018 is quite busy. On the one hand, I need to prepare for my physics GRE and my physics application documents. On the other hand, I started a research project with Professor Jim Freericks I met in 8.04x and 8.05x. Walter, a fellow student in 8.05x, told me a research opportunity with Jim on September 2018. Jim and I started the research shortly afterwards. All the calculations were finished at the end of December 2018 and Jim finished the first draft one month later. Working with Jim is a pleasant and rewarding experience. He was always there when I had difficulty understanding some calculations or concepts. He was patient and would work you through every technical details if I saw them for the first time. Although he tended to work way faster than I did (after all he is an experienced physicist!), he would become busy from time to time, so I could have opportunity to catch up! I became more comfortable with complicated algebra manipulations during the research, and started to have a more physicists’ mind set. Unsolved problems could look dirty and messy at the beginning, but we physicists are never scared off if they are interesting and important. Things tend to become elegant and simple when you solve them piece by piece. I enjoy this process. Jim is now recruiting fellow MOOCers to work on different research projects. He works on quantum mechanics pedagogy, quantum computing, and the non-equilibrium many-body problem. I guess the projects he works with MOOCers are mainly related to his book called Quantum Mechanics without Calculus, where he tries to do quantum mechanics in a representation-free fashion, that is, not relying heavily on coordinate space representation, bur rather construct the discrete spectrum algebraically. For ordinary physics study, I finished Ph106c: Classical Electrodynamics, given by Professor Sunil Golwala from Caltech. The problems and solutions are not available from internet without Caltech’s IP address. I use its course schedule and the detailed lecture notes. The course textbook is Griffiths’s Introduction to Electrodynamics, and Jackson’s Classical Electrodynamics. I only went through Griffiths’s textbook. This course is a continuation of the freshman electromagnetism course, and emphasize advanced mathematical techniques which are necessary for partial differential equations. You also need to work heavily with vector calculus in this course. All are essential techniques in theoretical physics. Oxford kindly recorded a course on solid state physics called The Oxford State Basics, lectured by Professor Steven H. Simon. The sequence of the lectures matches that of the book The Oxford Solid State Basics written by Prof. Simon. This is an excellent introductory-level condensed matter physics course. And it can be taken once you finish your undergraduate-level quantum mechanics course, or equivalently 8.04x—06x series provided by MITx. Prof. Simon is a funny teacher and his enthusiastic is infectious! The assignments of this course are the same as the exercises in the book and you can find the solution manual of the book on the internet. ","date":"2019-01-21","objectID":"/posts/summary-for-2018/:2:0","tags":null,"title":"Summary for 2018","uri":"/posts/summary-for-2018/"},{"categories":["Year-end Reivew"],"content":"Non-physics work Nothing quite interesting, just routine work in structure engineering graduate school. I spent lots of time to improve my work on prediction of the hysteresis curve of RC columns. A lot of details were added to the hysteresis model and in turn more work was needed to be done in the prediction equation. A phenomenology approach was adopted, with no concern about mathematical structure, not quite interesting as far as I could see. But the resultant prediction equation based on 19 shear-critical columns do look satisfactory from an engineer’s perspective.
