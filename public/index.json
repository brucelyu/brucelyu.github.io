Like most people, I have been hearing about words like “quarks, hadrons, leptons” since junior high school. However, I have never known the next step for learning more about them. The talk by David Gross during a summer school in Sweden last summer completely aroused interest in this subject. During the lunar new year season, which was early February this year, I found time to dive into this subject a little. I want to first get an overview of this subject, focusing on building a physical picture and intuitive feelings, avoiding technical details as much as possible. Therefore, I started exploring all kinds of textbooks and videos to searchfor what I want.

Martin This book was recommended by my friend, Mark Weitzman, a few years ago. It is certainly not a popular science book for general audience, but a textbook for people who know undergraduate quantum mechanics very well. The first two chapters of this textbook, however, are what I’m looking for. It is a nice overview of several central questions, for example, from what evidence do we start to suspect a particle, like a proton, has inner structure, while some others, like an electron, doesn’t. Starting from chapter 3, detailed mathematical calculations come up. One of the feature of this textbook is that it only employed one-particle quantum mechanics to describe motions of elementary particles, avoiding a full but much more intricate and complicated field theory treatment. I want to study the details of the book in the future as a preparation for understanding quantum field theory in particle physics context.

His lectures and Feynman’s lectures share a very similar style. In his supplemental course, I found a series of 3 courses on Particle Physics, and also one course on Advanced Quantum Mechanics. As a warm-up, I first chose to take a look at the Advanced QM class I found hidden much jewelry. The first three lectures demonstrate how the rotational symmetry of an atom entails the degenerate structure in hydrogen atom energy spectrum. He then moved on, in the next two lectures, talking about how Pauli discovered the internal spin of electrons by studying this spectrum. There is a very fascinating discussion about the relationship between spin and fermion nature of electrons. The last five lectures focus on developing quantum field theory (QFT) formalism in the non-relativistic case. This exposition is hard to find elsewhere. Most QFT textbook starts by a full relativistic treatment, which makes it very hard to understand its connection with the non-relativistic QM taught in undergraduate time. The last lecture contains many intuitive discussions about the relativistic QFT of electron, Dirac equation, like how to understand the mysterious multi-component form of the electron wave function: where does the spin come and where does the concept of anti-particle comes.

Martin’s textbook, and I want to know more about the story of how people discovered and understand the standard model of particle physics. Again, I remembered the charm of another great physicist, ’t Hooft, during the Sweden summer school, and gladly found that he has written a book about this. It doesn’t feel like a popular science book because sometimes it feels quite detailed and technical. I believe the author has tried his best transitioning mathematical expressions into words. So, it is a very nice and rare book for people like PhD students or physicists who are not familiar with particle physics, since they have enough theoretical background. I feel it prepares me a lot for my future attack on QFT.

I must say it is not the simplest way to build your own personal website. In order to do this, you should be comforable with basic coding process and command line: for Mac it is terminal application, for windows, it is PowerShell Why? The whole process isn’t through graphic interface through clicking and dragging. Instead, we rely heavily on create and editing files to modify and add contents to our webpage.

Big picture of the process You first create your website locally on your computer and test it. Then, your upload it to you GitHub repository, and set up the repository to build you website automatically.

Install Hugo We use Hugo to build and modify our webpage. You can follow the official instruction. If you use Mac as I do, the insallation is very simple and quick.

Create your webpage You follow the official quick start to create your webpage. Here is a summary. First, in terminal, use cd command to change to a directory where you want to save your website. Then, you think of a name for the folder of your website; as an example, I use HugoPage. You run the command hugo new site HugoPage Hugo creates a folder with the name HugoPage for you. Inside the folder, you have a blank website with some basic files. Change to this folder in terminal and initialize an empty Git repository cd HugoPage git init Next, you need to choose a theme for your webpage here. It can be a temporary choice. For exmaple, I choose Mainroad. You can click Demo there to see an sample page. Then, if you want it, you click Download, bringing your to its GitHub repository. Read the Installation section of the GitHub repository of the theme. In this case, we run the command git submodule add https://github.com/vimux/mainroad.git themes/mainroad to download this theme repository locally to HugoPage/themes/mainroad folder. Then, continue following the Installation instruction of the theme, you edit the file HugoPage/hugo.toml and add a line theme = \"mainroad\" after the last the line of the file. Finally, you test the website to see how it looks like by running the command hugo server This command keeps your command line occupied and you will see .... .... Web Server is available at //localhost:1313/ (bind address 127.0.0.1) Press Ctrl+C to stop Copy and paste localhost:1313 to your web brower like Chrome and you will see a blank website. By modify and add files in HugoPage, you can change everything of the website and add posts or pages. Before talking about modifying the webpage and adding contents, let’s first show how to deploy this blanck website on GitHub. Press Ctrl+C to stop the hugo server command.

Host on GitHub Pages Now, we are ready to upload this folder HugoPage to GitHub and tell GitHub to build the website. It is super easy and fast! We follow official tutorial. First, you create a file HugoPage/.github/workflows/hugo.yaml, compy and paste the YAML in Step 6 of the above official tutorial into this file. No change is needed. Use git add . git commit -m \"Add workflow\" to commit everything. Then, login your GitHub and create a blank repository with name \u003cusername\u003e.github.io. Follow the instruction here to push our webpage HugoPage to this GitHub repository. Finally, follow Step 2 and 3 in Hugo’s official tutorial to tell the GitHub to use the workflow to build and deploy the website. You can find the url of your website in Step 8 to 10 of the official guide. Usually, the default is the same name as your website repository, \u003cusername\u003e.github.io. Use this url, you can see our blank website.

Do hugo new about/index.md and Hugo will create a folder called about and a file index.md inside this folder. The folder name is changeable, but the file name isn’t if you want to create a page. You will see the difference when we finish disucssing create a post below. Then, you can open the index.md file with any text editor you like and write what you want on the about page. The file is a markdown file, which is easy to edit. If it is the first time you write with markdown file, there are lots of tutorial online. Here is an good tutorial.
