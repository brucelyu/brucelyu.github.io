Wrtie down the $\\mathbf{Q}$ and $\\mathbf{\\Lambda}$ matrices and plug them into the right-hand side to check whether you reproduce the matrix $\\mathbf{S}$. Hint 1. The two columns of $\\mathbf{Q}$ are two eigenvectors and the eigenvalues are in the diagonal matrix $\\mathbf{\\Lambda}$. Hint 2. Since the matrix $\\mathbf{S}$ is symmetric, the matrix $\\mathbf{Q}$ can be made as orthgonal matrix if you rescale the eigenvecotors to ensure that they have unit length (In the above expression I gave you, they both have length $\\sqrt{2}$).

I must say it is not the simplest way to build your own personal website. In order to do this, you should be comforable with basic coding process and command line: for Mac it is terminal application, for windows, it is PowerShell Why? The whole process isn’t through graphic interface through clicking and dragging. Instead, we rely heavily on create and editing files to modify and add contents to our webpage.

Big picture of the process You first create your website locally on your computer and test it. Then, your upload it to you GitHub repository, and set up the repository to build you website automatically. Whenever you want to add new posts or modify your website, you do this locally on your computer, test it, and push to your GitHub repository. GitHub will rebuild everything and people can access the latest website.

Install Hugo We use Hugo to build and modify our webpage. You can follow the official instruction. If you use Mac as I do, the insallation is very simple and quick. You first install HomeBrew by running the following command in your terminal: /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\" With HomeBrew, install Hugo is super easy by running the command: brew install hugo ","date":"2023-07-15","objectID":"/posts/2023-07-15-hugo-github-page/:2:0","tags":null,"title":"Build a static website using Hugo and deploy it on GitHub","uri":"/posts/2023-07-15-hugo-github-page/"},{"categories":null,"content":"III. Create your webpage You follow the official quick start to create your webpage. Here is a summary. First, in terminal, use cd command to change to a directory where you want to save your website. Then, you think of a name for the folder of your website; as an example, I use HugoPage. You run the command hugo new site HugoPage Hugo creates a folder with the name HugoPage for you. Inside the folder, you have a blank website with some basic files. Change to this folder in terminal and initialize an empty Git repository cd HugoPage git init Next, you need to choose a theme for your webpage here. It can be a temporary choice. For exmaple, I choose Mainroad. You can click Demo there to see an sample page. Then, if you want it, you click Download, bringing your to its GitHub repository. Read the Installation section of the GitHub repository of the theme. In this case, we run the command git submodule add https://github.com/vimux/mainroad.git themes/mainroad to download this theme repository locally to HugoPage/themes/mainroad folder. Then, continue following the Installation instruction of the theme, you edit the file HugoPage/hugo.toml and add a line theme = \"mainroad\" after the last the line of the file. Finally, you test the website to see how it looks like by running the command hugo server This command keeps your command line occupied and you will see .... .... Web Server is available at //localhost:1313/ (bind address 127.0.0.1) Press Ctrl+C to stop Copy and paste localhost:1313 to your web brower like Chrome and you will see a blank website. By modify and add files in HugoPage, you can change everything of the website and add posts or pages. Before talking about modifying the webpage and adding contents, let’s first show how to deploy this blanck website on GitHub. Press Ctrl+C to stop the hugo server command.

Host on GitHub Pages Now, we are ready to upload this folder HugoPage to GitHub and tell GitHub to build the website. It is super easy and fast! We follow official tutorial. First, you create a file HugoPage/.github/workflows/hugo.yaml, compy and paste the YAML in Step 6 of the above official tutorial into this file. No change is needed. Use git add . git commit -m \"Add workflow\" to commit everything. Then, login your GitHub and create a blank repository with name \u003cusername\u003e.github.io. Follow the instruction here to push our webpage HugoPage to this GitHub repository. Finally, follow Step 2 and 3 in Hugo’s official tutorial to tell the GitHub to use the workflow to build and deploy the website. You can find the url of your website in Step 8 to 10 of the official guide. Usually, the default is the same name as your website repository, \u003cusername\u003e.github.io. Use this url, you can see our blank website.

We show how to add an about page below, which serves as a template for adding further new pages for your website, like CV page or showcase page. Let’s start. Do hugo new about/index.md and Hugo will create a folder called about and a file index.md inside this folder. The folder name is changeable, but the file name isn’t if you want to create a page. You will see the difference when we finish disucssing create a post below. Then, you can open the index.md file with any text editor you like and write what you want on the about page. The file is a markdown file, which is easy to edit. If it is the first time you write with markdown file, there are lots of tutorial online. Here is an good tutorial. At last, remember to change the line on the top of the file draft: true to draft: false.

Do hugo new posts/first_post.md which creates a folder posts and a file first_post.md inside. Here, both the name of the folder and the name of the file are changeable.

In the fold of your website HugoPage, you can find a file hugo.toml. Open this file with an editor and add the following text in [menu] [[menu.main]] name = 'Home' pageRef = '/' weight = 10 [[menu.main]] name = 'Posts' pageRef = '/posts' weight = 20 [[menu.main]] name = 'About' pageRef = '/about' weight = 30 It is not hard to guess what this file does. Save the file and close. Now, run hugo server in your terminal and browse you website in your web browser. Can you see the menus and your newly added page and post? To make the change public, just add and commit all the change using git and push to your GitHub. After a minute or so, you can see the change on your public website. Have fun fiddling with your new webpage!
