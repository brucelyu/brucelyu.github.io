Like most people, I have been hearing about words like “quarks, hadrons, leptons” since junior high school. However, I have never known the next step for learning more about them. The talk by David Gross during a summer school in Sweden last summer completely aroused interest in this subject. During the lunar new year season, which was early February this year, I found time to dive into this subject a little. I want to first get an overview of this subject, focusing on building a physical picture and intuitive feelings, avoiding technical details as much as possible. Therefore, I started exploring all kinds of textbooks and videos to searchfor what I want.

Martin This book was recommended by my friend, Mark Weitzman, a few years ago. It is certainly not a popular science book for general audience, but a textbook for people who know undergraduate quantum mechanics very well. The first two chapters of this textbook, however, are what I’m looking for. It is a nice overview of several central questions, for example, from what evidence do we start to suspect a particle, like a proton, has inner structure, while some others, like an electron, doesn’t. Starting from chapter 3, detailed mathematical calculations come up. One of the feature of this textbook is that it only employed one-particle quantum mechanics to describe motions of elementary particles, avoiding a full but much more intricate and complicated field theory treatment. I want to study the details of the book in the future as a preparation for understanding quantum field theory in particle physics context.

His lectures and Feynman’s lectures share a very similar style. In his supplemental course, I found a series of 3 courses on Particle Physics, and also one course on Advanced Quantum Mechanics. As a warm-up, I first chose to take a look at the Advanced QM class I found hidden much jewelry. The first three lectures demonstrate how the rotational symmetry of an atom entails the degenerate structure in hydrogen atom energy spectrum. He then moved on, in the next two lectures, talking about how Pauli discovered the internal spin of electrons by studying this spectrum. There is a very fascinating discussion about the relationship between spin and fermion nature of electrons. The last five lectures focus on developing quantum field theory (QFT) formalism in the non-relativistic case. This exposition is hard to find elsewhere. Most QFT textbook starts by a full relativistic treatment, which makes it very hard to understand its connection with the non-relativistic QM taught in undergraduate time. The last lecture contains many intuitive discussions about the relativistic QFT of electron, Dirac equation, like how to understand the mysterious multi-component form of the electron wave function: where does the spin come and where does the concept of anti-particle comes.

It doesn’t feel like a popular science book because sometimes it feels quite detailed and technical. I believe the author has tried his best transitioning mathematical expressions into words. So, it is a very nice and rare book for people like PhD students or physicists who are not familiar with particle physics, since they have enough theoretical background.

Then, you think of a name for the folder of your website; as an example, I use HugoPage. You run the command hugo new site HugoPage Hugo creates a folder with the name HugoPage for you. Inside the folder, you have a blank website with some basic files. Change to this folder in terminal and initialize an empty Git repository cd HugoPage git init Next, you need to choose a theme for your webpage here. It can be a temporary choice. For exmaple, I choose Mainroad. You can click Demo there to see an sample page. Then, if you want it, you click Download, bringing your to its GitHub repository. Read the Installation section of the GitHub repository of the theme. In this case, we run the command git submodule add https://github.com/vimux/mainroad.git themes/mainroad to download this theme repository locally to HugoPage/themes/mainroad folder. Then, continue following the Installation instruction of the theme, you edit the file HugoPage/hugo.toml and add a line theme = \"mainroad\" after the last the line of the file.

This course introduced basic concepts of Quantum Mechanics and did standard 1-D potential examples, such as square wells, Dirac-delta potential and harmonic oscillators, along with several important theorems for 1-D potential. Besides, it gave a detailed treatment on scattering states in 1-D, covering topics like time delay, Levinson’s theorem and resonance. The course ended with central potential and Hydrogen Atom. It was a challenging but rewarding course, and of course, interesting! What makes this course stand out among all other online courses is its active discussion forum. I met lots of interesting physics and math geeks there, Mark, Jolyon, Jim, BlueFlow and Jonathan, and the discussion about physics with them made my learn experience vivid and lovely (Actually, I read their discussions in forum most of the time). Later in September 2018, Jim offered me an unexpected research experience, which was the first time I worked with a real physicist! 8.04x, Quantum Mechanics 8.370x, Quantum Information Science February is holiday season in China, I finished Jacob Linder’s video lectures on Classical Mechanics, based on Goldstein’s textbook. Jacob Linder walked you through Goldstein’s book step by step, demonstrating many examples, so you could learn to do these calculations with him. However, since I’ve learned much about Mechanics in Mechanic Engineering courses in my home institute and want to learn more about Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Formulations, it turned out that this course was too introductory for me. It didn’t go much deep in these two formulations and the problem sets were not quite challenging. I would recommend this course to those who learned classical mechanics for the first time. In addition, I tried 8.370x, Quantum Information Science, provided by MITx. This course was not as excellent as 8.04x, so I only finished the first part. I planed to study quantum information theory after finishing 8.04—06 series. The spring semester in my home institute started in March, as did the continuation Quantum Mechanics course 8.05x, Mastering Quantum Mechanics. 8.05x started by reviewing key theorems for 1-D potential. The treatment was more systematic and rigorous than 8.04x. After introducing the mind-boggling Stern-Gerlach experiment that demonstrated the quantum mechanical nature of nature, it continued to give rigorous explanation of operators and vector space followed by Dirac’s bra and ket notation. After the training of the first half part of 8.05x, your mind would be quite familiar about operators and vectors. The remaining part focused on the application of operator and algebraic method on examples like harmonic oscillators and angular momentum. Coherent state and squeeze state were also introduced, which is kind of introduction to quantum optics. 8.05x, Mastering Quantum Mechanics 6.041x, Introduction to Probability My feeling was that 8.05x was not as difficult as 8.04x. It represented the same idea of quantum mechanics using operator and algebraic approach, which I think is much superior to differentiation and integration approach. The important information can be encapsulated compactly into the algebraic relation of operators (or more specific, commutators) and the derivation will be mostly algebra manipulation, which is much easier and more straightforward than dealing with differentiation and integration. Remember how the algebraic method for harmonic oscillator works like magic, and the calculation of related expectation values will be quite trivial using abstract states, annihilation and creation operators, without requiring any specific representation in position or momentum space. 6.041x, Introduction to Probability: Part 2—Inference and Processes, ran in p","date":"2019-01-21","objectID":"/posts/summary-for-2018/:1:0","tags":null,"title":"Summary for 2018","uri":"/posts/summary-for-2018/"},{"categories":["Year-end Reivew"],"content":"Second Half of the Year Second half of 2018 is quite busy. On the one hand, I need to prepare for my physics GRE and my physics application documents. On the other hand, I started a research project with Professor Jim Freericks I met in 8.04x and 8.05x. Walter, a fellow student in 8.05x, told me a research opportunity with Jim on September 2018. Jim and I started the research shortly afterwards. All the calculations were finished at the end of December 2018 and Jim finished the first draft one month later. Working with Jim is a pleasant and rewarding experience. He was always there when I had difficulty understanding some calculations or concepts. He was patient and would work you through every technical details if I saw them for the first time. Although he tended to work way faster than I did (after all he is an experienced physicist!), he would become busy from time to time, so I could have opportunity to catch up! I became more comfortable with complicated algebra manipulations during the research, and started to have a more physicists’ mind set. Unsolved problems could look dirty and messy at the beginning, but we physicists are never scared off if they are interesting and important. Things tend to become elegant and simple when you solve them piece by piece. I enjoy this process. Jim is now recruiting fellow MOOCers to work on different research projects. He works on quantum mechanics pedagogy, quantum computing, and the non-equilibrium many-body problem. I guess the projects he works with MOOCers are mainly related to his book called Quantum Mechanics without Calculus, where he tries to do quantum mechanics in a representation-free fashion, that is, not relying heavily on coordinate space representation, bur rather construct the discrete spectrum algebraically. For ordinary physics study, I finished Ph106c: Classical Electrodynamics, given by Professor Sunil Golwala from Caltech. The problems and solutions are not available from internet without Caltech’s IP address. I use its course schedule and the detailed lecture notes. The course textbook is Griffiths’s Introduction to Electrodynamics, and Jackson’s Classical Electrodynamics. I only went through Griffiths’s textbook. This course is a continuation of the freshman electromagnetism course, and emphasize advanced mathematical techniques which are necessary for partial differential equations. You also need to work heavily with vector calculus in this course. All are essential techniques in theoretical physics. Oxford kindly recorded a course on solid state physics called The Oxford State Basics, lectured by Professor Steven H. Simon. The sequence of the lectures matches that of the book The Oxford Solid State Basics written by Prof. Simon. This is an excellent introductory-level condensed matter physics course. And it can be taken once you finish your undergraduate-level quantum mechanics course, or equivalently 8.04x—06x series provided by MITx. Prof. Simon is a funny teacher and his enthusiastic is infectious! The assignments of this course are the same as the exercises in the book and you can find the solution manual of the book on the internet. ","date":"2019-01-21","objectID":"/posts/summary-for-2018/:2:0","tags":null,"title":"Summary for 2018","uri":"/posts/summary-for-2018/"},{"categories":["Year-end Reivew"],"content":"Non-physics work Nothing quite interesting, just routine work in structure engineering graduate school.
