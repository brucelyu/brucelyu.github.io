Hi there! It's Xinliang Lyu (Bruce) here!

Right before I started my PhD program in the University of Tokyo (UTokyo) in September 2019, I created my personal blog.
Its main purpose is sharing my thoughts on physics that I was learning, as well as more general books I read, which are mainly about science and philosophy.
A majority of the blogs are about my life in UTokyo from 2019 to 2024.
It mainly contains my study notes about physics, math, philosophy, mixed with my other activities like movies, TV drama, music, and some random thoughts.

The blog was originally hosted on a private server and built using WordPress.
After I graduated from my PhD program in 2024, I started to convert the blog to a Hugo site and host it on GitHub, which seems more compact and easy to maintain.
*At this point (April 2025), the migration is still going on.*

This site might also contain instrumental, technical and practical staffs about tools on the internet, including
- How to build a webpage
- How to set up a App to keep a research diary 

and other similar things related to coding and what a geek (like guys in the TV drama, [Silicon Valley](https://silicon-valley.fandom.com/wiki/Silicon_Valley)) might do.
