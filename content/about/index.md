This site contains instrumental, technical and practical staffs about tools on the internet, including
- How to build a webpage
- How to set up a personal cloud drive
- How to set up a personal notes symchronized using the personal clould drive

and other similar things related to coding and what a geek (like guys in the TV drama, [Silicon Valley](https://silicon-valley.fandom.com/wiki/Silicon_Valley)) might do.

On the contrary, my [main site](https://xllyu.org/) is much more abstract and philosophical.
It mainly contains my study notes about physics, math, philosophy, mixed with my other activities like movies, TV drama, music, and some random thoughts.
